I can't believe SassConf is happening. Every day as I work on the final orders and logistics, welcome another sponsor, see the love and excitement on Twitter I smile at how far we've come. 

SassConf is happening in large part due to the support, trust, and encouragement from vital sources to NYC tech community. I'd like to take the time to acknowledge them. 

## New Work City

If anyone knows about building community, it's [Tony Bacigalupo](http://about.me/tonybgoode). Tony's been apart of coworking since the Jellynew y days and [New Work City](http://nwc.co/) is NYC's first coworking space. It is where I got my roots in coworking. Back in April 2011, Tony and [Peter](https://twitter.com/chislett) took a risk and let me host the first [NYC Sass and Compass meetup](meetup.com/nyc-sass/). It was an incredibly generous gesture. Prior NWC had hosted many many meetups but eventually scaled back to balance the needs of the community. However, both Peter and Tony avidly support their members and so they gave me a 3 month trial period. And NYC Sass and Compass Meetup was born. 

We grew rapidly. Pretty soon we got too big for the space and our time came to close. 

Suddenly, I found myself in a predicament I'd heard all to often from meetup organizers: finding a space. (For some reason) space in New York is a precious commodity. But true to its origins—the city of dreams—I was talking to my fellow [StartupBus](http://startupbus.com/) Alum [Jonathan Berger](https://twitter.com/jonathanpberger) about it one day at an [Alley NYC](http://www.alleynyc.com/) party—another amazing coworking community—and he mentioned that Pivotal Labs may be interested. 

## Pivotal Labs

[Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com/) is every organizers dream. Talk about supporting the community. Pivotal Labs is a very special player in the NYC tech ecosystem. They host an amazing array of events each night out of their space. They not only provide space, but open up their wonderful kitchen with its delicious beers and snacks. May more companies follow in their footsteps.

Pivotal gave NYC Sass a permanent home. It was immensely helpful to have a steady  night where people knew they could find us. Our community has been able to grow because of Pivotal's support.

## Simple Reach

One of my goals as an organizer was to open up another meetup focused on more hands-on learning. Our monthly meetups aim to reach intermediate and advanced users and I wanted to ensure newcomers to Sass had an opportunity to receive help. SassHack was born. The first SassHack happened because our member Matt Shif opened up his company space. It was a great event, but the sadly wanted to charge and we needed a space for free. 

StartupBus again to the rescue. Andrea Mignolo, 2012 Alum, Lead Designer at [SimpleReach](http://simplereach.com/) opened up her office to our group of enthusiasts. We meet the Saturday after the meetup and hack on projects, teach, and hang out. Developing a spot where members know they come for resources is invaluable asset to growing a stronger front-end community.http://simplereach.com/ 

## Meetup.com

It goes without saying that NYC Sass & Compass Meetup wouldn't exist without [Meetup.com](meetup.com). When we started there was only one Sass Meetup—yay Dale Sande in Seattle for getting it rolling! Now there are seven meetups across the world dedicated to Sass and Compass. 

After a year and half of NYC Sass and Compass Meetup, we've arrived to SassConf. In just under three weeks, the creators of Sass and some of its most popular extensions and the designers and developers that love it and use it each will unite in the city of dreams. We are making history. 

I believe magic comes from following ones dreams. It takes determination, drive, and a strong, supportive community. Chris Eppsetein, Senior Engineer at Linked-In, creator of Compass Meta-Framework, and SassConf keynote couldn't have put it better: It takes a village to build change. 

Thank you New Work City, Pivotal Labs, SimpleReach, Meetup.com, StartupBus, GreenSpaces, Brooklyn Creative League for believing in our dream and helping to build a better more beautiful web, community, and world
