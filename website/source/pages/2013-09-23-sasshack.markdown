SassHack is open all day October 13th. Work on projects, get answers, pick up new tips, share your solutions, take the plunge and setup Sass. 

If you want to get involved and have not taken the plunge, this is a great forum for learning how to contribute to Sass to make it better.

### Sass Projects whose Maintainers will be at SassConf

Add your project to the public wiki [https://sasshack.hackpad.com/](https://sasshack.hackpad.com/)
