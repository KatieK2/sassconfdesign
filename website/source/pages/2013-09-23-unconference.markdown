We had an overwhelming number of session submissions. So many that we decided to add another day to SassConf. October 13th is filled with workshops lead by industry leaders; a [SassHack](/pages/sasshack), and an UnConference. 

> a siren song for those whose main weapons are HTML, Sass and maybe a touch of Javascript. This is a declaration of independence from the backend. 
  **Hampton Catlin***, Keynote, October 13, 2013*

Anyone can propose a session, but it does not gaurentee a space. We encourage you to add what you want to teach or learn to the wiki. Upvote proposals. In the event of a space jam, the crowd will decide.
