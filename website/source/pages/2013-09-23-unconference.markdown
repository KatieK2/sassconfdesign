We had an overwhelming number of session submissions. So many that we decided to extend our plan for a one day, single-track conference plan to a two-day conference. 

Hampton Catlin's grito for the front-end revolution kicks us off for a day filled with workshops taught by industry leaders, an UnConference where attendees take charge on what they want to learn. Propose to lead a session or look for a teacher on a topic.

We've purposely organized it so that we, the attendees, shape our own future. We are the leaders of the change we want to see. We hope it results in many laughs, commits, merges, knowledge transfer, and new friendships.

**Sign-up to lead a session for a room October 13 from 8-9:30AM**.  [HackerPad](https://hackpad.com/SassConf-UnConference-Oct.-13th-RFCQnAVo8VJ) to start collecting interest from attendees.
