SassConf is happening in large part due to the support, trust, and encouragement from vital sources to NYC tech community. We'd like to take the time to acknowledge them for the great work they do in the community and thank them for supporting us from the starting days of [NYC Sass and Compass Meetup](meetup.com/nyc-sass/).

[Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com/) is a very special player in the NYC tech ecosystem. They host an amazing array of events each night. They not only provide space, but open up their wonderful kitchen with its delicious beers and snacks. May more companies follow in their footsteps.

Pivotal gave NYC Sass a permanent home. It was immensely helpful to have a steady  night where people knew they could find us. Our community has been able to grow because of Pivotal's sustaining support.

[SimpleReach](http://simplereach.com/) opened up their offices to our group of enthusiasts to host our monthly NYC SassHack. We meet the Saturday after the meetup and hack on projects, teach, and hang out. Developing a spot where members know they come for resources is invaluable asset to growing a stronger front-end community.

If anyone knows about building community, it's [Tony Bacigalupo](http://about.me/tonybgoode). Tony's been apart of coworking since the Jelly days and [New Work City](http://nwc.co/) is NYC's first coworking space. Tony and [Peter](https://twitter.com/chislett) took a risk and let us host the first [NYC Sass and Compass meetup](meetup.com/nyc-sass/). NYC Sass and Compass Meetup was born at NWC.

It goes without saying not a single Sass & Compass Meetup would exist without [Meetup.com](meetup.com).  Meetup was found with the mission of bringing people together locally,

When NYC Sass and Compass Meetup started there was only one Sass Meetupâ€”yay Dale Sande in Seattle for getting it rolling! Now there are seven meetups across the world dedicated to Sass and Compass. 

Magic comes from following ones dreams. It takes determination, drive, and a strong, supportive community. Chris Eppstein, Senior Engineer at Linked-In, creator of Compass Meta-Framework, and SassConf keynote's title couldn't have put it better: *It takes a village to raise a website*, or in our case, ***to raise a community*** 

Thank you New Work City, Pivotal Labs, SimpleReach, Meetup.com, StartupBus, GreenSpaces, Brooklyn Creative League for believing in our dream and helping us live our dream of SassConf 2013.
