You can travel the world one bite at a time in [New York City](/pages/nyc-primer). Although we are known for our [bagels and schmear](http://foursquare.com/sassconf/list/bagel--schmear), we wanted to take a different route than the traditional conference food fare. We've enlisted the help of our food sponsors and an an array of fantastic local New York caterers to provide you fantastic breakfast, lunch, and snacks both days of the conference.

## SassConf smörgåsbord made possible by the generous support from our Food Sponsors

Raised by her grandparents on a farm in Vladivostok, Russia, Maria was exposed to the arts of canning fresh produce, curing meats, making jams, butchering fish, baking breads, all at a very early age. After mastering her skills as a vegetarian chef in her almost two year residency at Tassajara and Green Gulch Zen Monasteries, she returned to NYC to work with well known chefs in NYC (David Burke, Jason Tillman, to name a few), and refined cooking with poultry, meat and fish.
