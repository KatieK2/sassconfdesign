# Sass Conf logo

I(Scott) have already done a fair amount of logo research, sketching, and iterating. It is still not done but this is the direction it is going in.

## Current status

NOT FINAL â€” Still refining basic curves then getting into flourishes and detail.

## Formats

I usually draw in type design programs like Glyphs which uses the UFO format. I am keeping a .otf and .eps for accessability.
